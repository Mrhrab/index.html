    If you’re like most people, your hairless cat breed identification strategy involves a single breed: the Sphynx. Because
    the Sphynx is so well-known, it’s easy to assume that it’s the only hairless breed on the planet.</p>

    <h2 class="hdngg">Sphynx</h2>
    
<img class="sphynx" width="500" src="cat3.jpg">

    <p class="paraone"><big>When</big> most people think about hairless cats, they imagine the Sphynx. This breed was originally called the Canadian
    Hairless cat.
    </br>
    It all started in 1960’s Toronto, when a shorthaired cat named Elizabeth gave birth to a kitten with no fur. A limited
    gene pool and poor understanding of the hairless genes spelled a struggle. Pioneering the breed took years. The first
    natural litters of Sphynx kittens were born in Toronto and Minnesota about a decade later.</p>

    <h2 class="bambino">Bambino</h2>

    <img class="imgbambino"; width="500" src="bambino.jpg">

            <p class="paratwo"><big>This</big> cat is, essentially, a bald dwarf.Bambino is an Italian word meaning “baby”. Indeed, if you swaddled this little nugget in a blanket, it could pass as a
            human infant. This cat is a little chunk of naked kitty on four short legs. They’re the result of breeding between
            munchkin cats for their dwarfism and Sphynx cats, which lend the Bambino a hairless appearance. The breed is currently
            considered experimental and is quickly gaining popularity.</p>

     <h2 class="headingthree">Peterbald</h2>
       
        <img class="peterbald" src="peterbald.jpg">

            <p class="parathree"><big>This</big> cat is a distinctive combination of the Donskoy and Oriental Shorthair. It has the hairlessness of the Donskoy and
            the elongated face, enormous ears, and almond-shaped eyes of Oriental Shorthair.Interestingly, the Peterbald possesses an unusually high metabolism and tends to heal more quickly than other cats.
            
            The breed was first created in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1994 and was recognized by TICA in 2009, but is still seldom
            seen outside of Russia.
